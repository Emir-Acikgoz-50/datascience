<h1>Data Exploration</h1>

When it comes to data exploration i've done a couple of things. I've namely:

- explored the main datasets
- looked at google trend functionality

<h2>Exploring the main datasets</h2>

At the first of the project we received a dataset from our project owner. This dataset was in csv (comma's separated values) format and consisted of nearly ten-thousand rows and 5 columns. The column definitions were as follows.

1. **index column**: Signifies the index of each row, starting from zero
2. **process day**: Indicates the day in which a certain amount of packages were processed.
3. **customer id**: The id of the customer
4. **package amount**: the amount of packages for that day
5. **package amount next day**: the amount of packages for the next day
  

<h2>Google Trends</h2>
