<h1>4.2. Data Cleansing</h1>

When it comes to cleaning the data, i haven't realy done much. This is because the dataset was already quite clean. For example, the dataset didn't contain any missing or inconsistent values. Eventhough some customers didn't exists in some years, these values were appropriately set to zero.
