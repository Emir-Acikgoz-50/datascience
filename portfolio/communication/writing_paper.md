<h1>5.2. Writing Paper</h1>

When writing the paper, i contributed mainly on two parts, which are the results and the conclusion. Both the results and the conclusion are split up into two parts, one for multivariate linear regression and one for SARIMA. Since i worked on multivariate linear regression, i wrote that part of both the results and the conclusion. I also took part in making sure that the paper looked adequate, following examples on what a paper should look like.
