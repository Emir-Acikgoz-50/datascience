<h1>5.1. Presentations</h1>

During the project, we had to do a weekly presentation. As a group, we decided to rotate the role of presentor each week, so everyone  would do an equal amount of presentations. I was the presentator for the following sprints:

- Sprint 3
- [Sprint 8](https://github.com/Rikku77/datascience/blob/master/portfolio/communication/presentations/ppt%20maandag%20week%208.pptx)
- [Sprint 14](https://github.com/Rikku77/datascience/blob/master/portfolio/communication/presentations/ppt%20week%2014.pptx)

**Note**: For some reason the presentation for sprint 3 wasn't uploaden on teams and i can't find it anymore. Therefore, there will be no link to that presentation.
