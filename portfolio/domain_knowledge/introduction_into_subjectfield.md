<h1>2.1. Introduction into the subject field</h1>

Data science is all about analysing data and discovering insights from that data to solve complex problems or achieve a certain goal. That goal (or problem) is often too complex or expensive for human intelligence to solve, so data scientists use a more “data centric” approach to solve these problems. Basically, learning a model to perform a certain task or achieve a certain goal.

Within the study of data science, we often use machine learning. Machine learning is a study of algorithms that computers use to perform a certain task without explicit instructions. In regards to the project, i mainly foccused on regression, which is of the supervised learning category. Regression means predicting a numerical continous variable. When it comes regression you have tons of individual models you can use. For example, a linear regression model is a very common model for regression problems. Linear regression basically means predicting some independent response variable using one or more explanatory variables.
