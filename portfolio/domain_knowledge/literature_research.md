<h1>Literature Research</h1>

During the project, i looked into literature to get some insights on how machine learning models, worked and what sollutions where possible on predicting time series.  I started by reading a book called *introduction to machine learning with python* by Andreas C. Muller and Sarah Guido <sup>[1]</sup>. This book gave me some insight on what machine learning is and why it is used.
