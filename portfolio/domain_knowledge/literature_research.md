<h1>2.2. Literature Research</h1>

During the project, i looked into literature to get some insights on how machine learning models, worked and what sollutions where possible on predicting time series.  I started by reading a book called *introduction to machine learning with python* by Andreas C. Muller and Sarah Guido <sup>[1]</sup>. This book gave me some insight on what machine learning is and why it is used. That machine learning is all about extracting knowledge from data and that it is used in many applications like: Netflix, many modern websites, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and many more. It is used to automate decisions that are simply too complex or too resource intensive for human beings to do. Besides reading the book, we also searched articles about timeseries in machine learning and what models could be used for such a problem. According to my own research i found a couple of models we could use for predicting timeseries<sup>[2]</sup>. These were:

- ARIMA
- Artificial Neural Networks
- HWES

Another side of my literature research, was techinally oriented. Sometimes i didn't know how to implement something in python, so documentation from the imported libraries like: Pandas<sup>[3]</sup> and sklearn<sup>[4]</sup>, made things relatively easy.
