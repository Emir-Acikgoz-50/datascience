<h1>1.1. Task Definition</h1>

The goal of the project is predicting the amount of packages that PostNL (an e-commerce and package delivery company) had to process on a daily basis. This is important for the company, because if they can acurately predict how many packages they need to proces daily for each customer, they can better anticipate on unexpected scenario's. TFurthermore, they also want to automate their entire package processing chain to prevent extra costs and delays.
