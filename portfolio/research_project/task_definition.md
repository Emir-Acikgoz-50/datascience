<h1>1.1. Task Definition</h1>

The goal of the project is predicting the amount of packages that PostNL (an e-commerce and package delivery company) has to proces on a daily basis. This is important for the company, because if they can acurately predict how many packages they need to proces daily for each customer, they can better anticipate on unexpected scenario's and prevent extra costs by automating their entire package processing chain. Therefore, we came up with the following research question:

- *How can PostNL apply machine learning models, to predict how many packages need to be proccesed for the next day?*

Subsequently, we also came up with corresponding subquestions. These are:

1. *What are the most commonly used models for timeseries?*</br>
2. *Which models are best for our dataset?*</br>
3. *What additional data can be used to improve the predictions?*</br>
4. *How reliable are the predictions?*</br>

These subquestions were formed according to the chosen it-research methodolgies and their corresponding strategies. For example, the first question was formed from the literature study methodology (belonging to the library), the second question was formed from prototyping methodology (belonging to the workshop), the third question was formed from the data analysing methodology (belonging to the lab) and the fourth question was formed from the product review methodology (belonging to the showroom).
