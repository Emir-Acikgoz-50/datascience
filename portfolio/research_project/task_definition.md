<h1>1.1. Task Definition</h1>

The goal of the project is predicting the amount of packages that PostNL (an e-commerce and package delivery company) has to proces on a daily basis. This is important for the company, because if they can acurately predict how many packages they need to proces daily for each customer, they can better anticipate on unexpected scenario's and prevent extra costs by automating their entire package processing chain.

So our research revolved around how we could predict the daily amount of packages. Therefore, we come up with the following research question:

  *How can PostNL apply machine learning models, to predict how many packages need to be proccesed for the next day?*
