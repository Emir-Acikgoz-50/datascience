<h1>Project Evaluation</h1>

During the project there were things that went well, but also things that could've been better. I think it is important to reflect on what went well and what didn't, so that i can make better decisions in the future. Therefore, i will split up this evaluation into four parts. First i will go into detail about my own contribution, secondly i will reflect on what i learned, then i will reflect on the group as a whole and lastly i will provide some my of thoughts about the directions on future work regarding the project.

<h2>Reflection on own contribution</h2>



<h2>Reflection on own learning objectives</h2>



<h2>Reflection on the group as a whole</h2>
