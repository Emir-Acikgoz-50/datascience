<h1>Project Evaluation</h1>

During the project there were things that went well, but also things that could've been better. I think it is important to reflect on what went well and what didn't, so that i can make better decisions in the future. Therefore, i will split up this evaluation into four parts. First i will go into detail about my own contribution, secondly i will reflect on what i learnedand lastly i will reflect on the group as a whole. All three evaluations will be done using the STARR method

<h2>Reflection on own contribution</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>

My contribution during the project mainly consisted of, exploring the main dataset (at the start of the project) and experimenting with multivariate linear regression.
