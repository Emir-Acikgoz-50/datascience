<h1>Project Evaluation</h1>

bron: https://www.scribbr.nl/stage/starr-methode/

During the project there were things that went well, but also things that could've been better. I think it is important to reflect on what went well and what didn't, so that i can make better decisions in the future. Therefore, i will split up this evaluation into four parts. First i will go into detail about my own contribution, secondly i will reflect on what i learnedand lastly i will reflect on the group as a whole. All three evaluations will be done using the STARR method

<h2>Reflection on own contribution</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3> 

During the project we worked in phases according to a global planning. This means that with phase, my contributions would be a bit different but still corresponding to the goal of that phase. For example, we started of the project with 3 to 4 weeks of devising a strategy as to how we were going to execute our research and exploring the main dataset. After that we started making predictions with several models, fune tuning them with different techniques and features. Lastly, focused on finishing the predictive models and writing the paper. 

<h3>Task</h3>

My contributions and tasks during the project consisted of, exploring the main dataset (at the start of the project) by making exploratory visualizations, devising a research plan, experimenting with google trends, implementing multivariate linear regression and writing parts of the paper.

<h3>Action</h3>

My approach concerning these contributions, was to use examples and the lectures as a guideline. For example, when i started to devise a researchplan, i used the research lectures, combined with a template on the internet<sup>[1]</sup> to come up with a research question, sub questions, a problem domain and so on. I approached things in this manner, because i wanted to stay consistent with the lectures, what i may get graded on and i didn't want to reinvent the wheel. 

<h3>Result</h3>

My contributions resulted in a lot of insights about the data that we got. For example, a barchart of the average amount of packages per weekday, made me realize that weekends (especially saturdays) were quite irregular when it came to the amount of packages. Besides that, i also made a decently performing multivariate linear regression model that can be used to make predictions on the amount of packages that need to be processed for a certain customer.  

<h3>Reflection</h3>

from the project and my own contributions, i learned how to implement a model from pre-processing the data, to evaluating the model and properly visualizing the data in python. I am very happy with what i learned, because as a software engineer it is very handy to know how to process and visualize data properly. I also think, as we move more towards prescriptive analytics, understanding how machine learning and deep learning works can be valuable when engineering software and working with data.

<h2>Reflection on own learning objectives</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>

Durng the project, my primary learning objective was to get an idea of machine learning and how to code in python. As a software engineer, knowing how a machine learning model and pipeline is supposed to be implemented can be very valuable and python is one of the most used programming languages.
