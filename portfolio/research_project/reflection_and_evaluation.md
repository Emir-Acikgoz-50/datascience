<h1>Project Evaluation</h1>

During the project there were things that went well, but also things that could've been better. I think it is important to reflect on what went well and what didn't, so that i can make better decisions in the future. Therefore, i will split up this evaluation into four parts. First i will go into detail about my own contribution, secondly i will reflect on what i learnedand lastly i will reflect on the group as a whole. All three evaluations will be done using the STARR method

<h2>Reflection on own contribution</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3> 

During the project we worked in phases according to a global planning. This means that with phase, my contributions would be a bit different but still corresponding to the goal of that phase. For example, we started of the project with 3 to 4 weeks of devising a strategy as to how we were going to execute our research and exploring the main dataset. After that we started making predictions with several models, fune tuning them with different techniques and features. Lastly, focused on finishing the predictive models and writing the paper. 

<h3>Tasks</h3>

My contributions and tasks during the project consisted of, exploring the main dataset (at the start of the project) by making exploratory visualizations, devising a research plan, experimenting with google trends, implementing multivariate linear regression and writing parts of the paper.
