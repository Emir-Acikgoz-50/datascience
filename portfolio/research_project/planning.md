<h1>1.2. Planning and Approach</h1>

During the project we mainly used scrum for our approach. Moreover, we also devised a global planning with multiple periods or phases. This was to give us some sort of general idea as too how we were going to plan our sprints.

Period | Description
:----- | :-----
Week 1 ~ 4 | Defining the research plan
Week 5 ~ 10 | Orientation and implementation of models
Week 11 ~ 15 | Improve models and look at other data sources
Week 16 ~ 20 | Completion research and writing of the paper

<h2>Scrum</h2>

First and foremost, when it came to scrum, i decided with my team that it simply wasn't feasible to completely execute an entire scrum proces. This is because most people in my team, besides me, weren't familiar with scrum and this project wouldn't be something normally associated with scrum, like a software development project is for example. So we basically decided that it would be best to only implement a fundemental number of elements (or events). These events were:

- Sprint planning
- Daily stand-up
- Sprint review/retrospective
