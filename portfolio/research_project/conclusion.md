<h1>1.4. Conclusion</h1>

The result of the research project consists of two predictive machine learning models. One of these model is multivariate lineair regression, which i have worked on. This model can quite accurately predict the amount of packages on a daily basis ([*see chapter 3*](https://github.com/Rikku77/datascience/blob/master/portfolio/predictive_analysis/multivariate_lineair_regression.md)). Therefore i can confidently say that the goal of the research has been reached ([*see chapter 1*](https://github.com/Rikku77/datascience/blob/master/portfolio/research_project/task_definition.md)).
